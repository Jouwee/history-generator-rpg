## Quick-start
How do I quick-start the exploration?
Simpler quests?
## Exploration
While playing the game, you can find different things around the world that hint to the existence of interesting history: artifacts, legendary creatures, etc.

These hints can be:
- A statue of a hero with his legendary weapon;
- A old body of a mummified tattooed human, with his sword missing;
## Investigation
Now that you know hints about something that peaked your attention, you can start investigating.
- Question people from the town about who is depicted in the statue;
- Read books about the meaning of the tattoos;
- Look for gravestones of family members;

## Acquisition
Once you think you know enough information about the item in your interest, you can go and try to fetch it. This is where bosses and challenges will often come in play.
## Repeat
During the investigation and acquisition phases, you're also exploring, and therefore you can find new hints about new treasures.

It is extremely important that the loop is constant, and split across the world.
