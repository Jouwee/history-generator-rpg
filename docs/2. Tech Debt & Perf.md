## refactor - New asset manager

- Add to Game Context
- New Image asset

## refactor - Remove ID attribute from person, settlement and faction

## perf - Figure out why rendering is so slow

## perf - Better spatial searches

The majority of the current time spent in history generation is searching who is in a town to simulate battles

## perf - Slice people array on oldest person

I have tried creating auxilary arrays of people that are alive to not iterate over everyone, without sucess. It has always been faster to iterate everyone and filter out dead people.

But I haven't tried a simple slice.

Create an index (starting at 0) of the first alive index. Then, before each iteration, from that index up, stop at the first alive person again.

And only iterate from that index forward.

## refactor - Load definitions from yaml/toml files

- stuff like materials and biomes need a "string-key" to be referenced by other configs

[obj:pine_tree]
spritesheet_pick_one = ["pine_tree.png"]
vegetation_placement {}

## refactor - Re-implement noise

Package-size, learning
## refactor - You need to pass too many parameters to read an asset

Like the size of the spritesheet, not part of the key
## refactor - optimize build time with workspaces

### Interact dialog has to have a different input method to have access to state

### Container has to know every single child type there is

### HistoryVec and Person don't actually have unrepresentable invalid states, as you can create an ID from scratch
