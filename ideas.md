What is the minimum I need for the basic gameplay loop?

explored civilized area -> interact with people -> receive info -> investigate -> find artifacts + history
-> get quests -> do quests -> get more powerful

- D&D / BG / TTRPG bare-bones mechanics
  - ✓ Attributes
    - ✓ STR - Mellee damage
    - ✓ DEX - Dodge chance, AP / movement
    - ✓ CON - Health
    - INT - ???
    - WIS - ???
  - ✓ XP/Levels
    - ✓ Attribute increase
- Equipment
  - Armors
    - Heavy - 3 tiers

    - ✓ Piercing - 3 tiers
  - Consumables
    - Health potion

  - Resting at cities to recover health
- ✓ World interaction
  - ✓ Artifacts
    - ✓ More powerful versions of weapons generated through History
    - ✓ Ways to obtain those artifacts
  - ✓ People
    - ✓ Interacting with people to get information about other people, artifacts, etc
- Organic Questing
  - People have wants, problems, and riches. Do one in exchange for the other (make this more "mechanified")
  - How to make quests?

## idea - History simulation of Technology

Start with no tech, chance of someone/some faction learning a tech in a tech tree, that gives buffs. Chance to exchange techs on trades.

## idea - Legends simulation

- Some random events that can happen, such as:
  - Survived a great battle
  - Slain a great beast
  - Slept with the whole town
  - Add titles based on feats
  - Generate artifacts based on feats

## idea - Trait simulation

- People can have personality traits that affect chances, such as:
  - Violent - Increase chance of starting conflict

## inspect people

use a perception-like skill to see information about them

## caravans

caravans are group of people that move between places.

want to fund a settlement? you have to move there.
want to attack an enemy? you have to move there.

## city improvements

settlements always grow too big, given time.

having to collect say, gold, in order to build infrastructure (granaries, aqueducts, etc) to support bigger population will make only certain tiles thrive.

## settlement events

plagues, droughts, etc

## Better elevation generation

Nice procedural generator: http://procgenesis.com/WorldGen/worldgen.html
Erosion methods: https://github.com/dandrino/terrain-erosion-3-ways

- ✓ Render elevation in word view
  - ✓ Shadows on basic view
  - ✓ Explicit elevation view
- ✓ Plate tectonics simulation
- Slope
- Precipitation
- Erosion
- Volcanic activity
